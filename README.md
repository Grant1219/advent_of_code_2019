# Advent of Code 2019 solutions

I decided to try solving the challeges this year using C++ and maybe another language if I get bored.

These solutions are in no way meant to be clever or the best solutions. They are mainly written as I think through the problem and not optimized much afterwards.
I always prefer clarity over clever code, so you will probably notice the code is overly verbose at times.
